%   MINCUT   Graph Max-Flow/Min-Cut.
%   [FLOW,CUTSIDE] = MINCUT(SOURCESINK,REMAIN) returns a graph's maximum flow and minimum cut.
%   The graph is defined by two matrices given as the two function arguments:
%   
%   SOURCESINK: nx3 matrix where the first column has a node number and the other
%   two the correspondent weights of the arcs linking that node to the source and
%   sink respectively. There is one line for each node (n = total amount of nodes).
%   
%   REMAIN: this is an mx4 matrix containing the information about the links between
%   nodes and respective weights. Column 1 goes for starting node, column 2 for final 
%   node and the final two columns have the direct and inverse link weights respectively.     
%
%   The outputs are given by:
%   
%   FLOW: a scalar.
%   
%   CUTSIDE: nx2 matrix where the first column has a node number and the second column
%   has one of the following values: 
%
%   0 - the node stays at the source side of the CUT.
%   1 - the node stays at the sink side of the CUT.
