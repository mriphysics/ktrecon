function [x,n]=standardizeCoils(x,n,de)

%STANDARDIZECOILS   Applies standardization to the receiver channels 
%   X=STANDARDIZECOILS(X,N,{DE})
%   * X is an array
%   * N is an array of noise samples or a covariance matrix (considering
%   both quadrature receivers). Its meaning is determined from its
%   dimensionality
%   * {DE} is a flag to reverse the operation and destandardize the channels.
%   It defaults to 0 (standardization)
%   * X is the standardized set of measures (the method assumes equal dwell
%   times for noise and sampling and flat frequency response of noise samples)
%   * N as an output is the covariance matrix
